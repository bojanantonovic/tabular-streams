# Generalization of Java Streams

A Java stream is stream of unary data. Meaning: You can put only one array or any thing with one arrity. With **tabular streams** you can have multiple streams as a unit (bi-stream, tri-stream, ...).

## Advances compared to Java Streams:
- Simple architecture.
- Multiple executions allowed (Java Streams allow only one consumption)

## Differencies to Java Streams:
- No parallelization yet.
- No collectors.

# Usage
Just take a look at the JUnit 5 tests.
